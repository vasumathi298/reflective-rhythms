           <h1> ANXIETY </h1>
           <p>
            Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry, or nervousness when one is about to do something challenging. Everybody experiences anxiety across different situations, and it is a normal experience. However, anxiety becomes a medical condition when it is prolonged and starts to impact the way one would normally perform ordinary tasks. It can start affecting your sleep, your ability to work, and your relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anxiety is a natural part of the body's stress response, often referred to as the "fight-or-flight" response, which prepares us to react to potentially dangerous situations.

                  Stress and anxiety are not interchangeable terms, though the physical sensations may be very similar. Stress is the bodys reaction to a situation that requires a physical, mental, or emotional adjustment or response. It can have both positive and negative impact.
  Anxiety, on the other hand, often comes from a place of fear, uneasiness, or worry. While it is common to experience anxiety in our daily life, it can also manifest itself in the form of panic attacks, phobia, social anxiety and many other related symptoms. Further, stress can be a temporary condition, while anxiety can be more lasting, persistent and pervasive.
