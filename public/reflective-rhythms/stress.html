           <h1> STRESS </h1>
           <p>
            Stress is the body reaction to any change that it experiences, which requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. The word 'stress' is quite often used in a negative sense. But stress isn't always bad and it is a normal part of life. In fact, sometimes stress can be positive and can spur one to be productive, creative, prepared for challenges, and stay motivated and focused.
            </p>
            <p>
            But too much stress or prolonged stress can impact our physical and mental health. It can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
            When does stress become a matter of concern? When it becomes overwhelming and starts affecting your health, your productivity, your relationships, and the overall quality of your life.

        <p>A person can feel stress anytime a situation is seen as threatening, challenging and difficult to cope with. An extremely busy lifestyle with multiple responsibilities, aspirations, competition, coupled with poor nutrition and sleep, lack of relaxation, inadequate exercise, increased use of smartphones, and being confined indoors can increase the risk of stress.</p>

            Practicing self-care is a good step to begin with. Incorporating certain activities into your daily routine can help make stress management part of your lifestyle.

              <p>
                Stress and anxiety are not interchangeable terms, though the physical sensations may be very similar. Stress is the bodys reaction to a situation that requires a physical, mental, or emotional adjustment or response. It can have both positive and negative impact.
Anxiety, on the other hand, often comes from a place of fear, uneasiness, or worry. While it is common to experience anxiety in our daily life, it can also manifest itself in the form of panic attacks, phobia, social anxiety and many other related symptoms. Further, stress can be a temporary condition, while anxiety can be more lasting, persistent and pervasive.
